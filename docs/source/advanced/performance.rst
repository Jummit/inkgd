Performance
===========

*inkgd* is overall slow. The high number of allocations that **ink** requires
makes GDScript choke.

For instance, loading The Intercept will create about 30,000 objects.
*ipsuminious 12* —a generated story based on The Intercept that contains about
90,000 words and 4,000 choices— will create a whopping 360,000 objects.

GDScript struggles to keep the performances at acceptable levels when allocating
such a large number of objects, making the creation of stories the major
bottleneck.

There's also a significant memory footprint. *ipsuminious 12* takes about
250 MB of RAM.


Benchmarks
----------

The time required to create and allocate a story is benchmarked below.

All benchmarks use variations of *ipsuminious*, a story based on the
Intercept, which can replicate itself to artificially increase the number
of words and constructs. The growth is linear. Size 12 is 12 times bigger than
size 1.

*ipsuminious* doesn't reflect real-world conditions, but should still give you
a rough idea of the time budget you need to consider.

Alternatives to *inkgd*
-----------------------

If vanilla *inkgd* proves too slow for your needs, there are two options
involving Godot Mono.

1. use the (undocumented) compatibility layer of inkgd, that exposes
   the official C# implementation while keeping the same API;
2. use the official C# implementation through `godot-ink`_.
