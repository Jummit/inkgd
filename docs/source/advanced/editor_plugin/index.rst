Editor Plugin
=============

*inkgd* ships with an editor plugin providing two major features:

1. a fully-featured bottom panel which can manage and preview stories for you;
2. two import plugins to treat **ink** files as resources.

If the plugin is not already available, navigate to *Project > Project
Settings* and, in the *Plugins* tab, enable *InkGD*.
