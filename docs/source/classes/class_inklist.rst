InkList
=======

**Inherits:** Reference_


Description
-----------

The underlying type that's used to store an instance of a list in ink. It's not
used for the *definition* of the list, but for a list value that's stored in
a variable. Somewhat confusingly, it's backed by a Dictionary_, and has nothing
to do with an Array_.
