Introduction
============

*inkgd* is an implementation of the Ink_ runtime, in pure GDScript.

If you are not familiar with Ink, it's a good idea to take a quick look at
two documents from the original documentation:

- `Writing with Ink`_ – which describes how to write **ink** stories;
- `Running your Ink`_ – which describes how to integrate the **ink** runtime in a C# environment.

.. _Ink: https://github.com/inkle/ink
.. _`Writing with Ink`: https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md
.. _`Running your Ink`: https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/RunningYourInk.md

The GDScript API is 100% compatible with the original C# API, except for a
couple of minor divergences accomodating the differences between the two
languages. For more information, see :doc:`/advanced/differences_between_api`.

.. note::

    *inkgd* provides no GUI, only text. It's up to you to decide how to present
    the content to your players.

Playing a story typically involves repeating the following three steps until
the story reaches its end:

1. calling ``InkPlayer.continue_story()`` until a branch is found;
2. presenting an array of choices to the player;
3. reporting back the selected choice through
   ``InkPlayer.choose_choice_index()``.
